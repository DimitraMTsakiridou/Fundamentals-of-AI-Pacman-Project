AI Fundamentals: Pacman Projects
Course: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence
University: KU Leuven
Program: Master of Artificial Intelligence (Erasmus 2024-2025)
Source: Based on the CS188 Pacman projects from UC Berkeley.

Overview
This repository contains my implementations for the classic Pacman projects developed at UC Berkeley. The assignments are designed to teach foundational AI concepts by having students build intelligent agents for the game of Pacman.

Topics Covered
Project 1: Search - Implemented DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* search.

Project 2: Multi-Agent Search - Designed adversarial agents using Minimax and Expectimax.

Project 3: Reinforcement Learning - Implemented value iteration and Q-learning.

Project 4: Probabilistic Inference - Used Bayes' Nets and HMMs for tracking ghosts.
